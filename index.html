<h1>Hi there!</h1>
<p>I am a developer interested in game development and likes testing new ideas. This website has my portfolio showing off past web and software projects and my blog where I share thoughts and updates on things.</p>

<p>I am currently making a game with my friend in my spare time and contributing to a few open source projects on github.
