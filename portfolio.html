<h3><b>Sirius game</b><h3>
<p>The name of my current project I am working on with a friend in my spare time. I have posted devlogs about it on on my blog if your interested in its progress.</p>

<h3><b>Open source</b></h3>
<p>Contributed to a few different open source projects. For example raylib, a simple and easy to use library for video games programming. It is a C library and I wanted to see if I could use it from C# so I worked on creating a binding for it. Its still a work in progress but it is looking good so far!</p>

<p>This very website!</p>
<p>Started off as a simple HTML5 site that evolved over time. Now it uses jekyll to help generate the site and has really good support for blog posts. Currently hosted using github pages.</p>
