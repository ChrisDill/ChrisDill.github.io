<h3>Sirius game</h3>
<p>I am collaboratively working on a game in my spare time. It is a topdown sci-fi shooter inspired by games such as FTL - Faster than light and Heat Signature. I have a devlog series about it on my <a href="blog.html">blog</a>. It is being custom made in c#.</p>

<br>
<h3>Open source</h3>
<p>Made an binding for <a href="https://www.raylib.com/">raylib</a>, a simple and easy to use library for video games programming. Wanted to try using it with c# for game development. Developed project management skills and also learned more about git from using pull requests and forks.</p>

<br>
<h3>Mech shooter</h3>
<p>College project as part of a team. Gave myself a goal to make a prototype in Unreal for a first-person shooter but with mechs. Used the blueprint system for the logic and learned a bit about Unreal style c++. End result had 2 player controlled mechs in a level that could fight each other across a network.</p>

<h3>Portfolio website</h3>
<p>chrisdill.github.io which is this very website!</p>
<p>Started off as a simple HTML5 site that evolved over time into my personal portfolio. Started using jekyll to help generate the site and write blog posts about my work. Currently hosted using github pages.</p>
