<h3>Sirius game</h3>
<p>My main project I am working on with a friend in my spare time. Its a topdown sci-fi shooter inspired by games such as FTL - Faster than light and Heat signature. I have a devlog serious about it on my <a href="blog.html">blog</a>. It is being custom made in c# using raylib-cs.</p>

<br>
<h3>Open source</h3>
<p>Made a binding of <a href="https://www.raylib.com/">raylib</a>, a simple and easy to use library for video games programming. Wanted to try using it with c# for a game so I made a binding. Learned alot of useful skills such as project management, pull requests and forks.</p>

<br>
<h3>Mech shooter</h3>
<p>College project as part of a team. Gave myself a goal to make a prototype in Unreal for a first person shooter but with mech. Used the blueprint system for the logic and learned the basics of lower level c++. End result had 2 player controlled mechs on a platform that could fire at each other until only one is left.</p>

<h3>Portfolio website</h3>
<p>chrisdill.github.io which is this very website!</p>
<p>Started off as a simple HTML5 site that evolved over time into my personal portfolio. Started using jekyll to help generate the site and write blog posts. Currently hosted using github pages.</p>
