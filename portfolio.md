### Sirius game
I am collaboratively working on a game in my spare time. It is a topdown sci-fi shooter inspired by games such as FTL - Faster than light and Heat Signature.

### Raylib-cs
Made C# bindings for [raylib](https://www.raylib.com") which is a simple and easy to use library for video games programming. I wanted to see if I could use it with C# for game development. Improved my project management skills and gained experience with using git for larger projects.

### Mech shooter
College project as part of a team. Gave myself a goal to make a prototype in Unreal for a first-person shooter but with mechs. Used the blueprint system for the logic and learned a bit about Unreal style c++. End result had 2 player controlled mechs in a level that could fight each other across a network.
