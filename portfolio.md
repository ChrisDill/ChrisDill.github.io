### **Sirius game**
I am collaboratively working on a game in my spare time. It is a topdown sci-fi shooter inspired by games such as FTL - Faster than light and Heat Signature.

### **Open source**
Made an binding for <a href="https://www.raylib.com/">raylib</a>, a simple and easy to use library for video games programming. Wanted to try using it with c# for game development. Developed project management skills and also learned more about git from using pull requests and forks.

### **Mech shooter**
College project as part of a team. Gave myself a goal to make a prototype in Unreal for a first-person shooter but with mechs. Used the blueprint system for the logic and learned a bit about Unreal style c++. End result had 2 player controlled mechs in a level that could fight each other across a network.

### **Portfolio website**
<a href="https://chrisdill.github.io">chrisdill.github.io</a> which is this very website!
Started off as a simple HTML5 site that evolved over time into my personal portfolio. Changed to using jekyll generate the site and support blog posts using markdown. Currently hosted using github pages.
