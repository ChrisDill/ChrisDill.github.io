## Hi there!

This is my first devlog of the game. The idea behind this game is inspired by games like FTL - Faster than light and Heat signature that I enjoy playing alot.

The name for this project is called Sirius. 
Sirius is a 2D sci-fi game about travelling across a randomely generated galaxy exploring new worlds. All while gathering resources along the way to help get stronger and of course survive for as long as you can.

You will need to plan and find clever solutions to getting through areas. There are different unique enemy types you can encounter each with a style that you can try to add into your "master" strategy. :)

For example some enemies may be more aggressive and charge straight at you with no care for themselves whereas others may be patient and wait for you. This creates many cool encounters that you can fail immensely at until you get used to them. But thats okay because thats part of the fun and you can always start again with a even better plan. :)

The end goal is not yet decided. I have a few ideas I want to try out such as a end boss maybe at a hidden location or having a main quest line you can progress through in your journey to give background to the world and your character.

It is in very early development so there is not much to show just yet but there will be soon!
I will post some more updates on the game at some point with hopefully some gifs/images to show.
