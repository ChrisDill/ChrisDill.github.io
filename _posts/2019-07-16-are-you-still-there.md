A quick update to get me back into putting up posts since I haven't done any for ages.

Currently I am improving my bindings for raylib to C#. They work quite well although there are a few aspects making
a nice interface hard. I am trying to balance keeping it simple with being nice to use. I am also trying to automate the generation of them so they can stay up to date.

I also want to continue the game devlog for Sirius. Been going through my old code wondering what past me was thinking etc. :)
For a while I have gone between alot of side projects. Trying to limit myself so I finish a few things instead going forward.
