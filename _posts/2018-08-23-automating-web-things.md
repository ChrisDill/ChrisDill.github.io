Aswell as working on the game, I have been spending some time updating this website.
The biggest change is updating it to use [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) which is a static site generator.

The big reason for trying it was to automate adding new posts. All I have to do is create a new post with the format *Year-Month-Day-Name* and it will show up in the list. Amazing! :)

It took awhile to figure out however. Theres a good amount of resources out there but it takes getting used to the way it works. There are alot of templates that were helpful to reference.

The process for quickly running it is not the easiest. I ended up creating a script to run the site for me then I just edit the files refresh in browser to update.

Overall I am happy with the result. Im still undecided on the style and that will probably change alot as I figure that out.
